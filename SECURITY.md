## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you see a vulnerability, report it to staff ASAP. Contact DEMONITIZED BOI#1991 on Discord if you come across one.

## What happens when we recieve it?

When we recieve a report of a vulnerability, we disable the feature and begin to test it to find the vulnerability.

## What happens if it gets accepted?

We get on the task of fixing it as soon as possible. As we have to disable the feature to prevent abuse of it,
we post an alert on our news page. This is to notify people of the disabled feature. 

## What happens if it gets denied?

Aside from us having to waste time on finding a fake vulnerability, you may be placed on a watch list.
